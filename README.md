## ‚ñ∫ FEATURES

Neon-Sort is more than just a visualizer; it's a comprehensive suite of tools designed to help you understand, compare, and inspect sorting algorithms in a highly engaging way.

-   üé® **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort operate on the data in real-time, with a quirky, neo-brutalist aesthetic.
-   ‚öîÔ∏è **Algorithm Showdown**:
    -   **Visual Race**: Pit all algorithms against each other in a head-to-head race on the same dataset.
    -   **Instant Results**: Get an immediate, data-driven ranking of algorithm performance for any given array.
-   üî¨ **The Code Inspector**:
    -   View algorithm implementations in **Python, Java, C++, and C**.
    -   See the **currently executing line of code highlighted** in real-time as the animation runs.
    -   Convenient one-click **copy-to-clipboard** functionality.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **The Test Bench**:
    -   Generate random arrays or choose from specific presets like **Sorted**, **Reversed**, **Nearly Sorted**, or **Few Unique Values** to test algorithms against their best and worst-case scenarios.
-   ‚èØÔ∏è **The Inspector Controls**:
    -   Pause the animation at any point.
    -   Step through the sorting process **one operation at a time** (forwards and backwards) to deeply analyze the logic.
-   üîä **Audio Feedback**: Toggleable sound effects for array comparisons and writes provide an immersive, multi-sensory learning experience.
-   üì± **Fully Responsive**: A seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## üåê DEPLOYMENT

This repository is optimized for one-push deployment on **Vercel**.

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  Connect your repository to your Vercel account.
3.  Vercel will automatically detect the configuration in `vercel.json` and `package.json`, run the `npm run build` command, and deploy the static site from the `dist` directory.

Any subsequent pushes to the `main` branch will trigger automatic redeployments.
